        People love web and native apps for different reasons. React lets you
        build both web apps and native apps using the same skills. It leans upon
        each platformâ€™s unique strengths to let your interfaces feel just right
        on every platform.

        With React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can ship
        to many platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your
        organization can bridge the platform silos, and form teams that own
        entire features end-to-end.
