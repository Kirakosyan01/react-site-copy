        React is a library. It lets you put components together, but it doesnâ€™t
        prescribe how to do routing and data fetching. To build an entire app
        with React, we recommend a full-stack React framework like{" "}
        <a className={style.frameworks} href="https://nextjs.org/"  target="_blank">Next.js</a> or
        <a className={style.frameworks} href="https://remix.run/"  target="_blank">Remix</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        React is also an architecture. Frameworks that implement it let you
        fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even
        during the build. Read data from a file or a database, and pass it down
        to your interactive components.

      <Link to="/learn" className={style.get__started}>&#9741; Get started with a framework &#10095;</Link>
    </div>
